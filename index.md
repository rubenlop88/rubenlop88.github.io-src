I've build apps like [Indufar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=py.com.indufar.vademecum), 
[TAXit!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=py.com.taxit) and [Influenciadores](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=py.com.sodep.android.teleton_prototype), RESTful web services for [Personal](https://www.personal.com.py/#!/public/home/) and [DNCP](http://www.quecompramos.gov.py/) and many other enterprise apps, using technologies like Firebase, PrimeFaces, Angular, Ruby on Rails and Play Framework.
